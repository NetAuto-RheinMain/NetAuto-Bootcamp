# Day 3: Branching

**Goal:** Learn how to create and switch branches.

1. **Create a New Branch:**
   - Create a new branch called `feature-branch`:
     ```bash
     git branch feature-branch
     ```

2. **Switch to the New Branch:**
   - Switch to the `feature-branch`:
     ```bash
     git checkout feature-branch
     ```

3. **Make Changes and Commit:**
   - Create a new file called `feature.txt` and add some text to it.
   - Add and commit the file:
     ```bash
     git add feature.txt
     git commit -m "Added feature.txt"
     ```

4. **Switch Back to the Main Branch:**
   - Switch back to the main branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     ```

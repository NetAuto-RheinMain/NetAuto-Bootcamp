# Pygnmi
The idea behind pyGNMI is simple. That is a Python package, which you can use in your code to interact with the network functions using the gNMI. There is a number of issue we would need to solve during the development:

* implementation of both secure and insecure gRPC channels
* implementation of all RPCs (Capabilities, Get, Set, Subscribe) in a way it is easy to use them
* implementation of all options and arguments, but, again, it should be easy and convenient to use them

## Challenges 
We have multiple challenges for pygnmi for [Arista ceos](/Topics/Programming/Python/Challenges/pygnmi/Arista) and [Nokia SRLinux ](/Topics/Programming/Python/Challenges/pygnmi/Nokia) Routers

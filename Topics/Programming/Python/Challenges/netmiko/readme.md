# Netmiko
Netmiko is a Python library that simplifies the process of interacting with network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls with the help of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. It offers a consistent and user-friendly interface for executing commands, getting output, and, most importantly, automating various network management tasks.

# Programming
A programming language is a system of notation for writing source code such as used to produce a computer program. A language allows a programmer to develop human readable content that can be consumed by a computer but only after translation via an automated process that enables source code to be executable. Historically, a compiler translates source code into machine code that is directly runnable by a computer, and an interpreter executes source code without converting to machine code. Today, hybrid technologies exist such as compiling to an intermediate form (such as bytecode) which is later interpreted or just-in-time compiled to machine code before running.

Computer architecture has strongly influenced the design of programming languages, with the most common type (imperative languages) developed to perform well on the popular von Neumann architecture. While early programming languages were closely tied to the hardware, modern languages hide hardware details via abstraction in an effort to enable better software with less effort.

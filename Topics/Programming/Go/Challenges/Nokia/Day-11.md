## **Day 11: Introduction to NETCONF and YANG**

## **Concept:** 
Understanding NETCONF as a programmatic interface for network devices, its XML-based messaging, and the role of YANG data models in defining configurations and operational state.
## **Challenge:** 
Explore some basic SR Linux YANG models (e.g., `srl_nokia-interfaces.yang`) by either downloading them from the SR Linux documentation or directly from a running SR Linux node (`/opt/srlinux/models/`). Identify the XML paths for configuring an interface.

 **No Go code for this day, focus on conceptual understanding and YANG exploration.**

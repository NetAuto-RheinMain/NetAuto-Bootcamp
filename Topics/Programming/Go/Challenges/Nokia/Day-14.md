# **Day 14: Introduction to gNMI and Protocol Buffers**

## **Concept:** 
Understanding gNMI as a modern, high-performance API based on gRPC and Protocol Buffers for configuration, operational state, and streaming telemetry. Overview of `.proto` files and code generation.

## **Challenge:** 
Locate the gNMI `.proto` files (often available in OpenConfig or vendor-specific repos). Understand how they define data structures and services. 

**(No Go code for this day, focus on conceptual understanding).**

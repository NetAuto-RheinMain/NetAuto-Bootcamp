# Learning Programming Golang

**Target Audience:** Network engineers, DevOps engineers, and anyone interested in modern network automation using Go.

**Learning Objectives:**

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

  * Understand Go fundamentals relevant to network automation.
  * Automate configuration and state retrieval using NETCONF with Go.
  * Leverage gNMI for configuration, operational state, and streaming telemetry with Go.
  * Work with JSON and YAML data formats in Go for network configurations.
  * Build simple Go applications for network automation tasks.

## **Prerequisites:**

  * **Basic Linux Command Line Knowledge:** Familiarity with `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `docker`, `ssh`.
  * **Fundamental Networking Concepts:** Understanding of IP addressing, routing, interfaces, VLANs.
  * **Basic programming concepts** variables, loops, functions
  * **Docker Installed:** Containerlab relies on Docker. Ensure it's installed and running on your Linux machine (or WSL2 on Windows, or OrbStack/Docker Desktop on macOS with a Linux VM).
  * **Containerlab Installed:** Follow the official Containerlab installation guide: [https://containerlab.dev/install/](https://containerlab.dev/install/)
  * **Arista cEOS-lab Image:** You'll need to download the cEOS-lab image from the [Arista support portal](https://www.arista.com/en/support/software-download) (requires an Arista account, free lab versions are available). Import it into Docker: `docker import cEOS-lab-<version>.tar.xz ceos:<version>` (e.g., `ceos:4.30.6M`).
  * **Go Installed:** Download and install Go from [https://golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install).

## **Module 5 (Arista only): GoLang and gNMI for Streaming Telemetry & Configuration (Days 21-26)**
| Day | Description | State |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | 
| 21 | [Introduction to gNMI and Basic Connection](/Topics/Programming/Go/Challenges/Arista/Day-21.md) |   not tested |
| 22 | [gNMI `Get` RPC for Operational State](/Topics/Programming/Go/Challenges/Arista/Day-22.md) |  not tested |

| 25 | [Advanced gNMI Use Cases & Best Practices](/Topics/Programming/Go/Challenges/Arista/Day-25.md) |  not tested |

**Prerequisites for Module 5:**

* **Arista cEOS with gNMI enabled:** In your Containerlab YAML, you need to enable the gNMI server. Add the following to your cEOS node's `startup-config`:

```yaml
# ... inside ceos node startup-config ...
gnmi
    no shutdown
    transport grpc
    no shutdown
    port 6030
    vrf management
    !
```

*Note: gNMI typically runs on port 50051, but Arista EOS uses 6030 by default for gRPC. Ensure your firewall/security groups allow access to this port if running on a cloud VM.*

* **Go gNMI Client Libraries:** You'll need `go get` these:

    * `go get github.com/openconfig/gnmi/proto/gnmi`
    * `go get google.golang.org/grpc`
    * `go get google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/insecure` (for unencrypted connections)
    * `go get google.golang.org/protobuf/proto`
    * `go get github.com/openconfig/ygot/ygot` (useful for path building)
    * `go get github.com/aristanetworks/glog` (used by some Arista examples, though standard log is fine)

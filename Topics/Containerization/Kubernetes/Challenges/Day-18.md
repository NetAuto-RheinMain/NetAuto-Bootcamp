# **Day 18: Introduction to GitOps**

## **Concepts:**
* What is GitOps? Principles (Git as single source of truth, declarative configuration, automated delivery, pull-based reconciliation).
* Benefits of GitOps (auditability, traceability, faster deployments, disaster recovery, security).
* Difference from traditional CI/CD (push vs. pull model).
* Key components: Git repository, Kubernetes cluster, GitOps operator (e.g., ArgoCD, FluxCD).

## **Examples (Code):**
* Conceptual explanation of a GitOps workflow:
    1.  Developer commits changes to application configuration (e.g., a YAML file in Git).
    2.  GitOps operator continuously monitors the Git repository.
    3.  Operator detects changes, pulls them.
    4.  Operator applies changes to the Kubernetes cluster.
    5.  Cluster state converges with Git state.
* Diagrams comparing push-based CI/CD vs. pull-based GitOps.

## **Challenge:** 
Research and list three advantages and three potential disadvantages of adopting a GitOps approach compared to traditional CI/CD.

# Kubernetes 28-Day Tutorial: From Basics to Multi-Cluster GitOps Mastery
This 28-day tutorial will guide you through the exciting world of Kubernetes, from its fundamental concepts to advanced topics like GitOps with Helm, ArgoCD, FluxCD, and multi-cluster management. Each day includes explanations, practical examples, and challenges to solidify your understanding. **All hands-on examples will primarily use Kind (Kubernetes in Docker) for local cluster creation and management.**

## **Target Audience:** This tutorial is for developers, operations engineers, and anyone interested in understanding and working with Kubernetes. Basic familiarity with Linux command line and Docker concepts is beneficial but not strictly required.

## **Prerequisites:**

  * A computer with internet access.
  * A text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.).
  * A stable internet connection.
  * **Docker Desktop installed and running:** Kind uses Docker to run Kubernetes nodes.
  * **Kind CLI installed:** Follow official instructions (e.g., `go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.22.0`).
  * **`kubectl` installed:** Follow official instructions (e.g., `brew install kubectl` on macOS).
  * **`helm` CLI installed:** (Will be covered in detail on Day 15).
  * **`git` installed:** For GitOps examples.


## Overview

### **Week 1: Kubernetes & Kind Fundamentals**

### **Week 2: Advanced Kubernetes Concepts**

### **Week 3: Helm & GitOps**

### **Week 4: Multi-Cluster & Advanced Topics**


## ** Notes for Your Journey:**

  * **Clean Up:** After each day or week, remember to clean up your Kind cluster or specific resources to avoid resource conflicts or excessive Docker resource consumption.
      * `kubectl delete -f <your-file.yaml>`
      * `helm uninstall <release-name>`
      * `kind delete cluster --name <cluster-name>`
  * **Persistent Learning:** Kubernetes is vast and constantly evolving. This tutorial provides a strong foundation, but continuous learning through documentation, blogs, and community engagement is vital.
  * **Troubleshooting is a Skill:** The more you debug, the better you become. Don't be discouraged by errors; they are learning opportunities.

# Docker

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers package an application and all its dependencies (libraries, system tools, code, runtime) into a single, standardized unit. This ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments, from a developer's laptop to production servers.

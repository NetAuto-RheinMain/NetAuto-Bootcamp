| 1   | **Introduction to Computer Networks**                              | Overview of network types (LAN, WAN, wireless, etc.), common physical and logical topologies (bus, star, ring, mesh), and deep dive into the OSI model vs. the TCP/IP suite—roles and services of each layer.       |
| 2   | **IPv4 Addressing, Subnetting, DHCP**        | IPv4 structure (classes, binary, CIDR), subnet-mask calculations and efficient IP planning; DHCP lease process and client/server roles.                        |
| 3   | **Switching Fundamentals & MAC/ARP**                               | Ethernet switching concepts—frame forwarding, MAC learning tables, VLAN basics—plus Layer 2 addressing and ARP’s IP-to-MAC resolution mechanism.                                                                    |
| 4   | **VLANs, Inter-VLAN Routing & Spanning Tree Protocol**             | VLAN design for broadcast containment and security, router-on-a-stick/L3-switching between VLANs, and STP’s loop-prevention and convergence behavior.                                                               |
| 5   | **Router Architecture, Static Routing & Dynamic Routing Overview** | Router internals and packet-forwarding steps; when and how to use static routes; introduction to dynamic routing protocols and their trade-offs.                                                                    |
| 6   | **OSPF Link-State Routing & Routing Table Decision Logic**         | OSPF’s area hierarchy, LSDB flooding, cost-based path selection; longest-prefix-match, administrative distance and how routers build and choose optimal routes.                                                     |
| 7   | **Network Device CLI & Interface Configuration**                   | Command-line interface navigation, privilege levels, command syntax; configuring physical and logical interfaces, IP assignment, and port roles.                                                                    |
| 8   | **Device Security & Configuration Management**                     | Securing access via SSH, authentication methods and login banners; startup vs. running configs, saving changes, versioning and backup best practices.                                                               |
| 9   | **Troubleshooting Methodologies & Diagnostic Tools**               | Layered troubleshooting frameworks; hands-on with `ping`, `traceroute`, ICMP/TCP TTL behavior, and other key network utilities.                                                                                     |
| 10  | **Packet Analysis, Documentation & Integrated Design Review**      | Packet-capture theory and Wireshark basics; best practices for topology diagrams, IP schemas and config archives; apply all concepts to a simulated network to identify misconfigurations and propose improvements. |

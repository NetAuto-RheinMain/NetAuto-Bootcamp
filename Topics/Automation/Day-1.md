# Device Automation with Netmiko

Multi-vendor library to simplify CLI connections to network devices

Network automation to screen-scraping devices is primarily concerned with gathering output from show commands and with making configuration changes.

Netmiko aims to accomplish both of these operations and to do it across a very broad set of platforms. It seeks to do this while abstracting away low-level state control (i.e. eliminate low-level regex pattern matching to the extent practical).

This is where the basics starts and in order to get complete hands -on will need virtual lab where you can configure some devices. This lab will use containerlab.

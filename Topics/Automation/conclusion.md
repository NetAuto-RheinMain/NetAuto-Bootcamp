# Ansible vs Netmiko vs Nornior vs NAPALM vs Paramiko

| Feature                 | Ansible                                                         | Nornir                                                    | Netmiko                                               | Napalm                                                        | Paramiko                                               |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **What it is**          | Agentless automation/orchestration tool                         | Python-native automation framework                        | Python library for SSH to network devices             | Multi-vendor network abstraction library                     | Low-level SSH2 protocol library                         |
| **Configuration style** | YAML playbooks & inventories                                    | Python scripts (can use YAML for inventory)               | Pure Python code                                      | Python code & YAML for driver configuration                 | Pure Python code                                        |
| **Ease of use**         | Very approachable for sysadmins; lots of examples and modules   | Friendly if you know Python; fewer “magic” abstractions   | Straightforward API, but you write more boilerplate   | High-level methods make multi-vendor tasks simple            | Manual handling of SSH; more boilerplate and edge cases |
| **Learning curve**      | Moderate: learn YAML, inventory, modules, patterns              | Steeper: need solid Python skills and structure           | Gentle: basic Python + SSH/CLI commands               | Gentle: basic Python + Napalm API concepts                    | Moderate: need understanding of SSH internals            |
| **Parallelism**         | Built-in parallel execution across hosts                        | Built-in, customizable concurrency controls               | Manual (you’d script your own threading or loops)     | None built-in; often used with threading or Nornir runners   | Manual (threading/async required)                       |
| **Extensibility**       | Huge ecosystem of collections & plugins                         | Highly flexible: swap plugins, write your own             | Focused on SSH; combine with other Python libs        | Plugin-driven vendor support; extensible driver model         | General SSH support; build any SSH-based integration    |
| **Community & support** | Very large, active community; extensive docs                    | Growing network-automation community                      | Widely used in network-automation scripts             | Growing open-source community, backed by network operators    | Mature Python project, broad adoption                   |
| **Typical use cases**   | Multi-tier app deployment, config management, orchestration     | Custom Python workflows, testing, and grounding           | Ad-hoc scripts, proof-of-concept, simple tasks        | Model-driven state retrieval and config deployment            | Building custom SSH utilities, file transfer, exec      |
| **When to choose**      | You want YAML-driven, agentless, broad automation               | You want pure-Python control and reusability              | You need quick scripts to talk SSH/CLI                | You need vendor-agnostic, idempotent config/state operations | You need raw SSH control or advanced SSH features      |

# Terraform vs Opentofu vs Pulumi

| Feature              | Terraform                                                 | OpenTofu                                             | Pulumi                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Language**         | HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)                    | HCL (drop-in compatible with Terraform configs)      | General-purpose languages (Python, TypeScript, Go, .NET, Java) |
| **Approach**         | Declarative                                               | Declarative                                          | Imperative + Declarative                                       |
| **State Management** | Local `terraform.tfstate` or remote backends (S3, etc.)   | Same as Terraform (local or remote back ends)        | Service-hosted state by default (or self-managed backends)     |
| **Learning Curve**   | Moderate: learn HCL syntax & workflow                     | Moderate: identical to Terraform                     | Steeper: learn SDK in your chosen language plus IaC APIs       |
| **Ecosystem**        | Vast: 300+ official/community providers & modules         | Same provider ecosystem as Terraform                 | Growing: many first-class language SDK packages                |
| **Community**        | Very large (HashiCorp & broad OSS)                        | Emerging (Linux Foundation-backed, community-driven) | Medium: Pulumi Corp + active OSS community                     |
| **CLI & UX**         | `terraform` CLI with init/plan/apply workflow             | `opentofu` CLI mirroring Terraform commands          | `pulumi` CLI with preview/up flow                              |
| **Parallelism**      | Implicit in plan/apply; execution order by resource graph | Same as Terraform                                    | Explicit control via language constructs (async, loops)        |
| **Extensibility**    | Provider/plugin model; community collections              | Identical extensibility to Terraform                 | Full language power: loops, functions, libraries               |
| **Typical Use**      | Provision & manage cloud/on-prem infrastructure           | Same cloud/on-prem use cases as Terraform            | Multi-cloud infra, apps, config, and complex workflows         |

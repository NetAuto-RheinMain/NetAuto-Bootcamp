## Overview

Network automation improves efficiency, consistency, and scalability by turning manual CLI work into repeatable code. This bootcamp gives you hands-on experience with:

- **Netmiko** for SSH-based device scripting  
- **Ansible** for agentless orchestration  
- **Nornir** for Python-native parallel workflows  
- **Terraform** for declarative IaC  
- **Pulumi** for imperative+declarative cloud code  

---

## Day 1: Device Automation with Netmiko

- **Intro to Netmiko**: What it is and why use it  
- **Basic SSH scripts**: Connecting, sending `show` commands  
- **Real-world use case**: Backing up config on Nokia SR-OS / SR Linux  


---

## Day 2: Automating Networks with Ansible

- **What is Ansible?** Agentless, YAML-driven automation  
- **Inventories & Playbooks**: Define hosts and tasks  
- **Network modules**: `sros_command`, `srlinux.get`  

---

## Day 3: Network Automation with Nornir

- **Why Nornir?** Pure-Python, plugin-driven framework  
- **Inventory & Tasks**: YAML or code-based host definitions  
- **Parallel execution**: Run tasks across multiple devices  

---

## Day 4: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform & OpenTofu

- **IaC concepts**: Declarative configuration, state management  
- **Terraform vs OpenTofu**: Compatibility, ecosystem, CLI workflow  
- **GNS3 provider**: Manage virtual labs  

---

## Day 5: Cloud & Hybrid Automation with Pulumi

- **Pulumi overview**: Code-first IaC in Python/TypeScript/Go  
- **AWS EC2 example**: Provision a web server, security groups, and export outputs  
- **State backends**: Pulumi Service vs self-hosted

## Overview

Network automation improves efficiency, consistency, and scalability by turning manual CLI work into repeatable code. This bootcamp gives you hands-on experience with:

* **Netmiko** for SSH-based device scripting
* **Ansible** for agentless orchestration
* **Nornir** for Python-native parallel workflows
* **Terraform** for declarative IaC
* **Pulumi** for imperative+declarative cloud code

---

## Day 1: Device Automation with Netmiko

* **Intro to Netmiko**: What it is and why use it
* **Basic SSH scripts**: Connecting, sending `show` commands
* **Real-world use case**: Backing up config on Nokia SR-OS / SR Linux

---

## Day 2: Automating Networks with Ansible

* **What is Ansible?** Agentless, YAML-driven automation
* **Inventories & Playbooks**: Define hosts and tasks
* **Network modules**: `sros_command`, `srlinux.get`

---

## Day 3: Network Automation with Nornir

* **Why Nornir?** Pure-Python, plugin-driven framework
* **Inventory & Tasks**: YAML or code-based host definitions
* **Parallel execution**: Run tasks across multiple devices

---

## Day 4: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform & OpenTofu

* **IaC concepts**: Declarative configuration, state management
* **Terraform vs OpenTofu**: Compatibility, ecosystem, CLI workflow
* **GNS3 provider**: Manage virtual labs

---

## Day 5: Cloud & Hybrid Automation with Pulumi

* **Pulumi overview**: Code-first IaC in Python/TypeScript/Go
* **AWS EC2 example**: Provision a web server, security groups, and export outputs
* **State backends**: Pulumi Service vs self-hosted

# NetAuto-Bootcamp

The **NetAuto-Bootcamp** is an immersive, hands-on program designed to give you a strong foundation in **network automation** and essential networking concepts. Whether you’re new to networking or transitioning from a traditional IT role, this program blends vendor-neutral theory with vendor-specific practice, covering Cisco IOS and Arista EOS.

You won’t just learn concepts—you’ll apply them. Expect to design, configure, automate, and troubleshoot networks in simulated environments using **[Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer)**, **[GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/)**, and **[EVE-NG](https://www.eve-ng.net/)**. You’ll work with **[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)**, **[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)**, **[OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/)**, and Python to automate tasks, compare vendor syntax, and solve real-world scenarios.
